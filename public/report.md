# **ETHiopia Pop-Up City: A Journey of Innovation & Community**

![ETHiopia Pop-Up City](report1.png)

## **üí´ A Moment to Reflect**

The idea of Eth-iopia was conceived in March, 2023 when after Mearaf met Ethereum leaders and had an elaborate decision with Aya Miaguchi, Songyi, and Yoseph on one evening and Vitalic in one afternoon, in Addia Ababa, Ethiopia.

Ethi-iopia emerged out of Xerxis, the first Etherem community in Ethiopia. And the name ETH-iopia initially was sugested by Anna Kumi, a person overseeing our grant proposal and who had interviewed Mearaf during the interview (hope records are kept ;) ) and a couple others also casually suggested the ETHiopia on different occasions.

Ethiopia was part of Xerxis as hackathon and conference event side of the program. But for the sake of categorization and priority, it had to be splited.

The expansion of ETHiopia to a pop up city, emerged out of one chill morning in breakfast table in Fumba town, Zanzibar, Kewetu Kwenue Chill, in June, 2024 with Mearaf and Kyle talking and ideating, as Kyle confidently suggested it can be popup city and pointing to practical things, it quickly developed in to a plan.

Mearaf started to follow through with asking the advices of Zanzalu organizers (Eva Klaus, Chance and Noah Chon Lee), writing idea notes (and latter researching and event article) and started inviting people to join from the ones that are near already, which ended up contributing and inviting others. Chance latter help us a lot by (personally) recommending many things including the speakers Una Wang of Zuitherland who endup giving scholarships to some of our community members.

A fun fact on naming, different thoughts of names like ETH2 (ETH square), ZuzalETH, and Zuthopia were in the name pool too. We all remember the movie Uthopia üòÖ

A bit of a background to tell our stories as we lived it and to remember who was there for us and those who are not present to harvest their fair credits. Anna Kumi, Chance, Noah, Kyle, Eva and all the friends we met after who help in different ways like Antoine Woody many thanks for the kind contribution.

What began as an ambitious idea turned into a living, breathing community of collaboration, where strangers became co-founders, where twitter friends became IRL frens, mentors became lifelong guides, and ideas once written in notebooks found their way into working smart contracts. ETHiopia was never just **_one_** event‚Äîit was an optimistic community of changemakers that looked for ways to connect with one another.

From the very first announcement, builders committed to traveling long distances to Addis Ababa... some even spending 24hours+ by road, because they recognized that this was something different. ETHiopia wasn‚Äôt just about learning how to build; it was about shaping the future of Web3 in a way that included Africa at the table, not as a guest but as a leader.

This report isn‚Äôt just numbers and metrics‚Äîit‚Äôs a love letter to everyone who believed in this vision and helped make it a reality.A testament to the brilliance, resilience, and untapped potential of African builders, thinkers, and dreamers.

## **‚ú® What We Built Together**

### **üèóÔ∏è Builder Residency: From Ideas to Reality**

- **28 projects launched** ‚Äì and let‚Äôs be honest, after Week 2, we had to encourage builders to focus on just one project. That was the hardest part‚Äîgetting brilliant, agile minds to concentrate on the power of one thing. For a full list of projects, check out [ETHiopia's project directory](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PSoMYhmLxf1jsMVBcLrlTqCNQVgJKKtIc4jz6NFIYvM/edit?gid=0#gid=0).

A few standout projects:

- **Hakiba** ‚Äì
- **Chapa Ride** ‚Äì X
- **DAOBitat** ‚Äì X

The beauty of ETHiopia wasn‚Äôt just in the final projects but in the late-night debugging sessions, the impromptu whiteboard discussions, and the collective resilience of builders who refused to settle for ‚Äúgood enough.‚Äù

ETHiopia proved that innovation doesn‚Äôt require glass skyscrapers or massive funding rounds‚Äîsometimes, it just takes a group of passionate people in a shared space, willing to be vulnerable with one another until they discover the one thing truly worth building.

### **üé§ Learning, Sharing, Growing**

- **Hands-on workshops** that left builders with tangible skills, not just theory.
- **Mentorship moments** that turned doubts into breakthroughs.

ETHiopia wasn‚Äôt just about learning how to use a new blockchain‚Äî**it was about learning how to think, question, and build with purpose.**

ETHiopia‚Äôs impact resonated far beyond the event itself. We were honored to be highlighted in **Cointelegraph**, showcasing Ethiopia as a rising hub for blockchain innovation.

> ‚ÄúETHiopia is the crypto event redefining the **humans** behind Africa‚Äôs web3 ecosystem.

## **üì¢ The Bigger Picture: What Comes Next?**

ETHiopia was never meant to be a one-time event. The connections formed will last a lifetime, but here‚Äôs the more practical answer:

‚úÖ **The African Onchain Collective (AOC) will continue to support builders in their founder journeys through mentorship and access to incubation programs.**  
‚úÖ **Access to grant programs unlocked by Mantle.**  
‚úÖ **Expanding our impact beyond this one event.**
