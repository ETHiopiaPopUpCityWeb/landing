_Caption: Builders, mentors, and dreamers coming together to shape the future of Web3 in Africa._

## **üí´ A Moment to Reflect**

What began as an ambitious idea turned into a living, breathing community of collaboration, where strangers became co-founders, where twitter friends became IRL frens, mentors became lifelong guides, and ideas once written in notebooks found their way into working smart contracts. ETHiopia was never just **_one_** event‚Äîit was an optimistic community of changemakers that looked for ways to connect with one another.

From the very first announcement, builders committed to traveling long distances to Addis Ababa... some even spending 24hours+ by road, because they recognized that this was something different. ETHiopia wasn‚Äôt just about learning how to build; it was about shaping the future of Web3 in a way that included Africa at the table, not as a guest but as a leader.

This report isn‚Äôt just numbers and metrics‚Äîit‚Äôs a love letter to everyone who believed in this vision and helped make it a reality.A testament to the brilliance, resilience, and untapped potential of African builders, thinkers, and dreamers.

## **‚ú® What We Built Together**

### **üèóÔ∏è Builder Residency: From Ideas to Reality**

- **28 projects launched** ‚Äì and let‚Äôs be honest, after Week 2, we had to encourage builders to focus on just one project. That was the hardest part‚Äîgetting brilliant, agile minds to concentrate on the power of one thing. For a full list of projects, check out [ETHiopia's project directory](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PSoMYhmLxf1jsMVBcLrlTqCNQVgJKKtIc4jz6NFIYvM/edit?gid=0#gid=0).

A few standout projects:

- **Hakiba** ‚Äì
- **Chapa Ride** ‚Äì X
- **DAOBitat** ‚Äì X

The beauty of ETHiopia wasn‚Äôt just in the final projects but in the late-night debugging sessions, the impromptu whiteboard discussions, and the collective resilience of builders who refused to settle for ‚Äúgood enough.‚Äù

ETHiopia proved that innovation doesn‚Äôt require glass skyscrapers or massive funding rounds‚Äîsometimes, it just takes a group of passionate people in a shared space, willing to be vulnerable with one another until they discover the one thing truly worth building.

### **üé§ Learning, Sharing, Growing**

- **Hands-on workshops** that left builders with tangible skills, not just theory.
- **Mentorship moments** that turned doubts into breakthroughs.

ETHiopia wasn‚Äôt just about learning how to use a new blockchain‚Äî**it was about learning how to think, question, and build with purpose.**

## **üì¢ The Bigger Picture: What Comes Next?**

ETHiopia was never meant to be a one-time event. The connections formed will last a lifetime, but here‚Äôs the more practical answer:

‚úÖ **The African Onchain Collective (AOC) will continue to support builders in their founder journeys through mentorship and access to incubation programs.**  
‚úÖ **Access to grant programs unlocked by Mantle.**  
‚úÖ **Expanding our impact beyond this one event.**
