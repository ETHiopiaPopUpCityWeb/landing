          For all the international blockchain community and individuals who are
          keen to make tangible change in the world, the ETHiopia pop-up city
          event in Ethiopia will be the perfect adventure to take part in as the
          Ethiopian tech demographics are still early with massive potential and
          a tech-pro government paired with a huge number of active youth, and
          full of contrast in the socio-economic aspect of life.

            The goal of ETHiopia is to embed blockchain in the daily

            technological, and lifestyle advancement, incorporating the network

          </h2>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
            The federal gov’t of Ethiopia is launching different special
            economic zones and one smart city. The one in the capital called
            Addis Tomorrow has just been launched and reported on X. A modern
            park project called Window of Africa on 85 hectares of land and
            another SEZ called Geda SEZ in Lume free trade zone near Addis Ababa
            were launched recently.
            <br />
            The SEZs are planned to diverge into sub-zones of the International
            Economic and Trade zone, Education and Culture zone, Finance and
            Business zone, and Modern housing and residential zone.
            <br />
            A few other world-class mega projects are under construction in
            Addis Ababa, explained in the video link here, where all have
            technology at their core. Among these Adwa Zero has been fully
            completed swiftly. Mohamadia Village, a luxury residency development
            project held by the private Saudi/Ethiopian billionaire Sheik
            Mohamed Hussein Al Amudi, is another great opportunity to propose an
            integration web3 solution.
            <br />
            Here is one of the general recent reports on the mega projects and
            here are the city’s state in just five months.

            Core Values
          </h2>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
            We intend to set the themes with the core values of: <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Progressive Decentralization:</strong> as every new thing
            takes time to set in and grow into the intended state or stage, we
            would like to take the implementation of decentralization in a
            progressive approach while introducing the benefits of using it.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Sustainable Advancement:</strong> any advancement we intend
            to bring as ETHiopia organizers and as an active global Web3
            community we would love to craft and install into the system, we
            have to be mindful of the sustainability of what we are building and
            the approach we are taking, taking into consideration of the current
            and potential factors. We and our participants can develop
            sustainable advancement strategies by iterating implementation,
            testing and observation, evaluation, and feedback on their
            approaches. This can also be open for progressive improvement.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Simple Solutions: </strong>
            simplicity for a clear problem can save months or years of hard work
            from being in vain. That’s not to condone oversimplification of
            problems or solutions. It’s to find the right balance between
            understanding and stating the core problem and finding the simplest
            yet efficient and sustainable solution design.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Experience Sharing: </strong>
            We will hold a stage for participants with rich experiences and
            backgrounds to share their wisdom, skills, and information with the
            community, and have Q&A sessions.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Challenges and Opportunities in Tech: </strong>
            we encourage and create ways for participants to share information
            about the challenges in the country and how those can be
            opportunities as well as discuss the already ripe opportunities for
            participants to see.

            Why Addis
          </h2>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
            <br />
            Vibrant youth in Crypto and Openess to Web3.
            <br />
            <br />
            Cryptocurrency usage in Addis Ababa is much more active than one
            from outside of the country would expect. The government is not
            against crypto nor it provides supporting policy. The people, mainly
            the majority of the literate youth generally use crypto as a way to
            access foreign currency and value storage without restrictions.
            <br />
            <br />
            The Government is Tech-pro. The gov’t has been building new
            world-class public infrastructures that can foster technological and
            socioeconomic developments. These include the fully operational
            Abrihot Library and the Science and Technology Museum, the
            under-development projects of the Smart City initiative in Addis
            Ababa, the Special Economic Zones, an all-in-one international
            convention and exhibition center in addition to the existing ones,
            Luxury Apartments in development at the heart of the city and
            multiple options of venues.
            <br />
            <br />
            Multiple high-standard Town/City Developments From the heart of
            Addis to the city skirts, there lie 5 modern mega-housing projects,
            luxury complexes, and luxury town developments under construction
            with previously in-the-market reputable developers and international
            developers some in joint with the City administration. We take this
            as an opportunity for our participants and us to seek partnerships
            with the city developers to embed the power of Web3 in the upcoming
            big towns where their residents can vary from 1,500 up to 60,000
            head of house.
            <br />
            <br />
            Talent The talent is still untapped, although outsourcing companies
            and websites are bringing a growing attraction to the local talent
            market. There are 100,000+ individual GitHub contributors from
            Ethiopia and there are still thousands of university graduates every
            year.
            <br />
            <br />
            Affordable Living Cost The cost of living is relatively low and
            value for money is fairly high. The $15-a-day standard of Zuzalu is
            achievable

          ETHiopia works to bring together gov’t agency leaders, high-profile

          digital artists, storytellers, and beyond—who are building towards a

            It will be one measure of success if we achieve “The form factor“,
            as Vitalic Buterin explained in his reflection on the Zuzalu
            experiment, where events and activities emerge from the community
            and become a trend in a way. If it felt like a city or a town and
            people reported satisfaction in their experience at the end of
            ETHiopia, it would mean another accomplishment.
            <br />
            If collaboration on projects emerged out of this event that wouldn’t
            happen otherwise, a solution is designed for a well-understood
            problem, a blend of cultures that turn out to be highly functional
            and sustainable, these also determine our success in ETHiopia.
